## Tic-Tac-Toe

First I started with the winning logic I had all the wining conditions in an array of arrays and track state (current player and board boxes) using a store object and just looping through the winning condition and check if all conditions numbers are included inside the current player moves, then I added a grid using CSS Grid and attach a click event handler for each box, then made sure the logic works, after that I added the api calls and style my GUI to look like a Windows 95 UI I don't know I kinda felt nostalgic doing this after all win95, that's when it all started for me.
